# bookmarks98

Having accumulated a lot of (mostly) front-end development bookmarks, I built this site to organize them and easily share them with others.

There are courses, articles, tutorials and tools for everyone. Whether you're just starting out or have experience in coding, I hope you find them useful! âœ¨

I built this for fun so the code is very messy for now, I will have to do a cleanup later :D
